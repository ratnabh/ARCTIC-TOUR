            <h2 class="h2">FAQS</h2>
        <br>
    <p class="p1">What kinds of trips do you offer?</p>
    <p class="p11">Whether your interest is in rafting trips, canoe trips, backpacking trips, base camp trips, packrafting trips, or winter trips we likely have a trip that you will enjoy. They are almost all fly-in/fly-out, wilderness expeditions to Alaskas wildest places. We offer an assortment of scheduled trips each year and we arrange custom trips for a variety of groups and individuals. We also provide logistical support, safety and guiding services for Film and Science expeditions through-out Alaska.</p>
    <p class="p2">How long do your trips last? What’s included in the cost?</p>
    <p class="p22">Our trips last anywhere from five to twenty-two days, and they start at about $3500/person with the average. Cost includes everything from the departure town (usually Fairbanks) and back (but see our Terms and Conditions on our Reservation Form about contingencies). All of our trips are fully guided by sturdy, experienced, mostly Alaskan, professional wilderness guides with training in first aid, river safety, bear safety, and “leave no trace” camping practices. Arctic Wild provides everything you will need, except for your personal gear (clothes and the like). You can bring your own tent, sleeping bag/ pad, and (for river trips) rubber rain gear and boots, or you can rent high-quality, affordable gear from us.</p>
    <p class="p3">How many other people will be on the trip?</p>
    <p class="p33">Including your guide(s), no more than ten people tops on a river trip, and seven for backpacks. Typical River trips have 6 people and backpacks usually have 4. For a Custom trip we may be able to accommodate larger groups.</p>
    <p class="p4">What’s a base camp trip?</p>
    <p class="p44">Base camp trips allow you to settle into one really great campsite for a week, with all exploring happening from there. Base camp trips are often focused on wildlife, be it caribou in the arctic, or bears in Katmai there will be great opportunities to watch and photograph animals. These are our easiest trips, and what you do in camp is up to you: day hike, read, knit, whittle, paint, yoga, tundra volleyball, etc. Your guide will offer suggestions, lead day hikes, or just let you relax in peace. It’s your trip to enjoy!</p>
    <p class="p5">What is your cancellation policy?</p>
    <p class="p55">Our policy is as follows:</p>
    <p class="p551"><b>DEPOSIT AND CANCELLAION POLICY : </b>A $500 non-refundable deposit per person/ per trip is required to confirm your reservation. Full payment is due 60 days prior to the trip start. Reservations made less than 60 days prior to the trip must be paid in full at time of booking. If you need to cancel more than 60 days prior to the trip, a refund will be given less $500 deposit. If 60 days or less notice of cancellation, 100% of funds paid will be retained by Arctic Wild.</p>
    <p class="p551"><b>TRIP CANCELLATION : </b>In the rare event that we cancel a trip, we will give you a full refund. In such cases, financial responsibility of Arctic Wild, LLC. will be limited to the amount actually paid to Arctic Wild, by the participant(s), and shall not be extended to cover any other costs incurred by the participant(s). We reserve the right to refuse or terminate any participant, from any trip. We also reserve the right to cancel trips for under-enrollment. Please contact us for the minimum number of participants for your trip. Additionally, Arctic Wild is not obliged refund trip costs in full or part if weather or other factors make completing the trip impossible or dangerous.
        <p class="p551"><b>DELAY AND SCHEDULE CHANGES : </b>All wilderness trips are dependent on the weather and flight-service schedules. Arctic Wild reserves the right to change trip dates and/or details for these or other reasons. Trip charges do not cover the costs incurred as a result of bad weather, sickness, or other contingencies. Participants who vary from scheduled itineraries shall bear any costs thereof, which are not deductible from the trip prices. Inclement weather, mechanical difficulties and a host of other factors can delay travel; we cannot assume financial responsibility for costs due to delays or other events beyond our control. We strongly encourage you to arrange your travel at trips end, to accommodate weather delays. Flights out of Alaska or other activities that will be difficult to reschedule should not be planned within 48 hours of the scheduled end of any trip.
